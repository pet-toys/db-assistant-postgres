# Security Policy

## Supported versions

The package major version tracks the latest supported .NET major version. Only
the latest major line receives security fixes.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | :----------------: |
| 10.x    | :white_check_mark: |
| 8.x     | :x:                |
| < 8.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public issues, pull
requests, or discussions.

Instead, use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting: open the repository's
**Security** tab and click **Report a vulnerability**. This keeps the report
confidential until a fix is available.

When reporting, please include as much of the following as you can:

- A description of the vulnerability and its impact.
- The affected package version(s) and target framework.
- Steps to reproduce, ideally with a minimal code sample.
- Any known workarounds or mitigations.

## What to expect

- We aim to acknowledge a report within a few days.
- We will keep you informed as we investigate and work on a fix.
- Once a fix ships, we will publish a security advisory and credit the
  reporter, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Scope

This library maps entity properties to columns and streams the values into
PostgreSQL through Npgsql's binary `COPY` import. It does not open connections,
manage credentials, or build ad-hoc SQL text on your behalf - the caller
supplies an already configured `NpgsqlConnection` and the destination table
name. Reports about how the mapping or the generated `COPY` command could
mishandle data, or how a caller-supplied table, schema, or column name could be
used unsafely (for example, an identifier-quoting gap), are in scope. Issues
caused solely by how a consuming application builds its connection strings,
protects its credentials, or sources the table and column names it passes in are
not.
